          "\nDixie Highway in Florida\n\nThe Dixie Highway followed several routes through Florida.\nHistory.\nIn January 2015, Thomas Masters, the mayor of Riviera Beach, Florida, attempted to have a stretch of Dixie Highway renamed \"Barack Obama Highway.\" The plan has not come to fruition.\nEast coast route.\nThe route below is in order from north to south.\nThrough St. Johns County, the Dixie Highway followed what currently exists as Old Dixie Highway from the Duval-St. Johns county line to Cezanne Circle, where it followed the northern part of Cezanne to Old Dixie Highway, once again. From there, it diverts away from U.S. Route 1 briefly, heading outwards to meet a small farm road that extends to the Intracoastal Waterway. It comes back and from there is cut into sections; usually only accessible from U.S. 1. It resumes south of Palencia, the road below Catlett Road and Crooked Creek Lane, as Old Dixie Drive. It soon renames to Old Dixie Highway once again. It has another gap at the airport, but resumes as U.S. Route 1. It proceeds onto San Marco Avenue, and turns right onto King Street. It turns left onto Leonard Street, which becomes Old Dixie Highway. [Please help fill in data between St. Augustine and Hastings, FL]. In Hastings, it follows Main Street onto County Route 13. It follows County Route 13 until it turns right to stay on it, and becomes Old Brick Road. It then proceeds into Flagler County. In Palm Beach County, the city of Riviera Beach renamed the stretch within the city limits to President Barack Obama Highway because town officials felt it had racist connotations. \nMiami–Marco route.\nThe Miami-Marco section is today known as part of the Tamiami Trail.\n\n"

She applies her unique perspective as a staff attorney at Disability Rights Advocates to dismantle digital barriers for people with disabilities. The White House has recognized Haben as a Champion of Change.\nMs Girma was born in California after her mother fled Eritrea in the early 1980s. Growing up in the US school system, she benefited from teachers who set high expectations, inclusive communities, and civil rights laws. She also had accessible technology, such as a digital Braille device - something her elder brother, who is also deafblind, did not have access to in Eritrea. Haben now works to change attitudes about disability around the world, including the development of accessible digital services: \"Digital information is just ones and zeroes...It can be converted into any kind of format. And those people who develop these services — programmers, technology designers — they have an incredible power to increase access for people with disabilities. And I hope they use it.”\nOn July 20, 2015 she met with US President Barack Obama to highlight the importance of accessible technology.\n\n"

          "\n2015 Xi Jinping visit to the United States\n\nThe 2015 state visit of Xi Jinping to the United States, which was from September 22 to 28, 2015, was the first state visit of Xi Jinping to the United States. It was his seventh visit to the United States. During the period of the visit, Xi attended the US–China Internet Industry Forum, visited the White House and met US President Barack Obama, and attended the 70th anniversary of the United Nations.\nBackground.\nXi's visit occurred at a time of high tensions in China-US relations. The Wall Street Journal quoted experts who said Xi's US visit was to promote local technology companies and to ask the US government to not retaliate in response to accusations regarding the People's Republic of China having engaged in hacking activities, but Beijing has repeatedly denied the allegations of the United States. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi's visit was to promote trust between the two countries.\nBefore this visit, the United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China held a hearing on human rights. Experts and members of Congress in attendance called on President Obama to ask President Xi to stop the persecution of Tibetans, Uyghurs, religious groups, non-governmental organizations, intellectuals, democracy advocates, and supporters of \"universal suffrage\" in Hong Kong.\nXi had previously visited the United States six times. His first visit was as part of a corn industry delegation to the state of Iowa in 1985. His most recent visit in 2013 was informal, in which he went to Sunnylands in California, and met with US President Barack Obama.\nProcess.\nSeptember 22: Arrival at Seattle and Speech Giving.\nOn September 22, 2015, Xi Jinping, and his wife, Peng Liyuan, arrived at Paine Field and stepped off an Air China aircraft at about 9:30 am (Pacific Daylight Time). Before his arrival at the Westin Seattle Hotel, protesters gathered downtown to highlight the Chinese government's human rights abuses and to voice other concerns, including Falun Gong practitioners. Supporters of Xi were also present with Chinese flags. The protesters dispersed by 6:00 pm.\nIn the evening, Xi attended a banquet speech at the Westin Seattle Hotel. In his speech, he mentioned several contentious issues in China–US relations, including on cybersecurity and China's economy. Xi's speech cited elements of American culture, included \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and the poet Walt Whitman. He also talked about his teenage years working on a farm in Yanchuan County, Shaanxi, China, during the Cultural Revolution. He linked this to the Chinese Dream, a individual work ethic which would strengthen the Chinese nation as a whole. Xi reiterated that China is against currency wars and will not lower the renminbi rate to boost exports. On the topic of his anti-corruption reforms, Xi said, \"It has nothing to do with a power struggle. In this case, there's no \"House of Cards\"\" – a reference to the Netflix political drama, which tops the list of most illegally downloaded shows in China.\nSeptember 23: Visiting and meeting business executives in Seattle.\nOn the second day of his trip, Xi visited Boeing Everett factory and viewed the final assembly lines for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Boeing 777 and Boeing 747-8. Xi announced China will buy 300 Boeing aircrafts, included 250 single-aisle Boeing 737s and 50 widebody jets for US$38 billion and build its first factory in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China. It will be Boeing's first non-US factory. The Chinese company Inspur and Cisco Systems said they will jointly sell networking technologies and products in China.\nAfter his Boeing visit, Xi attended an Internet industry forum held at the headquarters of Microsoft, located in Redmond. He said China would prioritize Internet security and defended self-governance at the country level with respect to Internet regulations. Thirty US and Chinese technology executives attended this forum and posed for a photo with Xi and Chief of the State Internet Information Office Lu Wei, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook, Amazon.com's CEO Jeff Bezos, Alibaba's CEO Jack Ma, and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella. Executives from Google and Uber, did not appear in this photo. Before photographing, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg spoke to Xi in Mandarin. On September 21, \"The Washington Post\" reported that technology executives were recommended to attend this forum, or risk their companies facing greater regulatory scrutiny in China.\nXi also visited Microsoft, where he met with Bill and Melinda Gates as well as senior executives and board members of the company. He had the opportunity to preview new technologies being developed by Microsoft. Nadella gifted him a 3D printed model of the \"Liulinhai\", the first Chinese ship to dock in the United States, in Seattle, in 1979 after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and the People's Republic of China.\nIn the afternoon, Xi Jinping visited Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington. He provided opportunities for students to experience Chinese music, government and culture. Lincoln's football players presented Xi with a Lincoln Abes jersey emblazoned with the number \"1\". Xi reciprocated with gifts of books and ping-pong equipment. He also invited 100 Lincoln High students to visit China in 2016. During this visit, the adherents of Falun Gong and Vietnamese protesters held up signs such as \"Stop Red China's Violations\" and shouted slogans such as \"Down with Red China\".\nXi attended a forum hosted by the Paulson Foundation, an economic think tank founded by Henry Paulson. He also attended a dinner organized by local Chinese.\nSeptember 24: Arrival at Washington D.C..\nXi and Peng left Seattle and flew to Washington, D.C. on September 24. They arrived at Joint Base Andrews and were greeted by United States Vice President Joe Biden. After greeting, a band played the US and Chinese national anthems. Then Xi and Obama had a private working dinner at the Blair House.\nSeptember 25: Meeting US President Barack Obama and State Dinner.\nOn September 25, Xi Jinping arrived at the White House. President Barack Obama welcomed Xi's visit. After the welcoming ceremony, Xi and Obama held their discussion in the White House. During this discussion, they mentioned peacekeeping, nuclear security, health, environment, cybersecurity, law enforcement and counterterrorism. Xi said that China would develop a \"national carbon emissions trading market\" in 2017, as a part of climate change statement. Later they held a news conference at Rose Garden. Obama and Xi reached a \"common understanding\" that neither the United States nor China should engage in state-sponsored cyberintrusions, and they would together seek the rules for appropriate conduct in cyberspace.\nIn the evening, Obama held a state dinner for Xi Jinping. It was Obama's second state dinner for a Chinese President. The White House invited Anita Lo, an Asian-American chef, to serve as a guest chef and to design the menu with Chinese elements. This state dinner's guests included US technology executives like Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Larry Ellison, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Obama said that China and the US together are \"stronger when we accept the diversity of the views and the contributions and uphold the rights of all our people\".\nSeptember 26: UN Sustainable Development Summit.\nOn September 26, Xi Jinping flew to New York City and attended the UN Sustainable Development Summit at the Headquarters of the United Nations. In his speech, he foresaw that \"the world would seek an equitable, open, comprehensive and innovation-driven development path in an effort to achieve common development of all countries after 2015\". He also announced the establishment of a South–South cooperation assistance fund. China will contribute US$2 billion to the fund to encourage developing countries to undertake the post-2015 development agenda. In addition, Xi has floated many important initiatives, such as the BRICS Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Silk Road Fund.\nDuring this visit, over 100 protesters held banners near the Headquarters of the United Nations, the Chinese consulate in New York City, the Chinese permanent mission to the UN, and Xi's hotel, the Waldorf Astoria New York. They called for Xi to prosecute the former leader of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin.\nSeptember 27: Global Women's Summit and Environmental issues.\nOn September 27, Xi Jinping and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon co-hosted the \"2015 Global Women's Summit\". In his speech, Xi said, \"As the Chinese people pursue a happy life, all Chinese women have the opportunity to excel in life and make their dreams come true\". He also announced China would contribute USD $10 million to UN Women. However, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized his attendance, considering women's rights abuses in China.\nPeng Liyuan attended UNESCO's Special Envoy for the Advancement of Girls' and Women's Education. Peng spoke in English, the first time she showed her fluency in the language to a large gathering. She said her Chinese Dream is that \"all children especially girls can have access to good education\".\nXi also attended the Leaders Working Lunch on Climate Change of the UN. He said China will control greenhouse gas emissions and put \"China's South–South Cooperation Fund on Climate Change\" into operation.\nSeptember 28: Speech at UN General Assembly.\nXi gave a speech at the General Debate of the 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. He mentioned the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day of the Second World War in China and emphasized that commemorating history is not revenge. Xi also said all economies should be build on an eco-environment, and green, low-carbon circular sustainable development platform. He also pledged US$100 million, over a period of five years, to the African Union.\n\n"

          "\nFates and Furies\n\nFates and Furies is a 2015 novel by American author Lauren Groff. It is Groff's third novel and fourth book. The book takes place in New York, and is essentially about how the different people in a relationship can have disparate views on the relationship. It has drawn many comparisons to the novel \"Gone Girl\", based on its themes, structure, and the dominance of the female in the key relationship of the plot. It is narrated first by the husband, Lancelot (Lotto), and subsequently by the wife, Mathilde. The novel was widely and highly praised by critics, with only a few occasional negative remarks focusing on moments of implausibility in the novel's second half. It was perhaps the most talked about English-language novel of 2015, and was on more critics' end-of-year lists than any other.\n\"Fates and Furies\" was nominated for a National Book Award, but ultimately lost to Adam Johnson's \"Fortune Smiles\". Amazon named it their book of the year, and President Obama — along with a host of celebrities — proclaimed it their favorite book of 2015.\n\n"

          "\nCompact of Mayors\n\nThe Compact of Mayors is a global coalition of city leaders addressing climate change by pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the future impacts of climate change. The Compact highlights cities’ climate impact while measuring their relative risk levels and carbon pollution. The Compact of Mayors seeks to show the importance of city climate action, both at the local level and around the world. The Compact was launched in 2014 by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the UN Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. The Compact represents a common effort from global city networks C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), ICLEI, and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), as well as UN-Habitat, to unite against climate change. 428 global cities have committed to the Compact of Mayors. The collective member cities comprise over 376 million people and 5.19% of the global population.\nHistory.\nThe Compact of Mayors was launched by Ban Ki-moon and Mike Bloomberg on September 23, 2014 at the UN Climate Summit 2014. The announcement detailed a commitment by 228 cities to cut up to 13 gigatons of carbon emissions by 2050. Mayors Eduardo Paes of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Anne Hidalgo of Paris, France and Park Won-soon of Seoul, South Korea joined in the announcement, representing C40, UCLG, and ICLEI. UN-Habitat provided additional support and oversight for the launch of the Compact.\nOn December 8, 2014, World Resources Institute, C40 Cities, and ICLEI revealed the Global Protocol for Community Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC), identified as the first set of standardized global rules for cities to measure and publicly report their carbon pollution emissions. This standard is the baseline on which Compact of Mayors was founded.\nAt the C40 Latin American Mayors Summit on March 27, 2015, Compact of Mayors officials launched the first public recruiting effort, receiving commitments from twenty Latin American mayors to join the Compact and accelerate their push toward low-carbon economies. On June 30, 2015, Mike Bloomberg and Mayor Anne Hidalgo jointly announced their plans to host a Climate Summit for Local Leaders on December 4 at Paris City Hall. The summit will convene mayors from around the world at the COP21 climate negotiations and build upon existing climate commitments under the Compact of Mayors.\nAt the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas on August 24, 2015, President Barack Obama challenged 100 cities to commit to the Compact of Mayors as part of a larger push to advance clean energy across the United States. Rio de Janeiro became the first city to achieve full compliance with the Compact on August 26, 2015.\nVice President of the United States Joe Biden called out the success of the Compact of Mayors in promoting action against climate change during his address at the US-China Climate Leadership Summit in Los Angeles on September 15, 2015. Later that month, on September 28, 2015, Mike Bloomberg announced the launch of a new parent organization combining the efforts of the Compact of Mayors and the Compact of States and Regions at NYC Climate Week.\nVice President Biden also cited the success of the Compact of Mayors while speaking on November 5, 2015 at the National League of Cities Congress of Cities in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. On November 20, 2015, the Compact of Mayors was recognized by the White House for exceeding 100 U.S. member cities prior to the COP 21 climate negotiations in Paris.\nMayors and other leaders of hundreds of cities committed to the Compact of Mayors attended the Climate Summit for Local Leaders at Paris City Hall on December 4, 2015 during COP21. At the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, Leonardo DiCaprio welcomed climate action commitments made by 392 cities under the Compact of Mayors, and he urged the local leaders in attendance to do more to fight climate change. \nFollowing the Climate Summit, 428 global cities had committed to the Compact of Mayors, representing over 376 million people worldwide. \nLeadership.\nThe Compact of Mayors was launched by UN Secretary General Ban Ki -moon and Mike Bloomberg. The organization receives oversight from ICLEI, United Cities and Local Governments, and C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. UN-Habitat has provided founding and operational support. Mayor Eduardo Paes of Rio de Janeiro currently serves as the chairperson of C40 Cities, while Mayor Kadir Topbas of Istanbul, Turkey and Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris, France currently serve as president and co-president of United Cities and Local Governments.
